Whats an object? - Something that a variable can refer to. Example:

a = "banana"
b = "banana"

In this case "banana" is the object since the variables a and b refer to it

Objects have attributes, which are named values that are part of the object. In Python, like many other programming languages, we use dot notation to designated an attribute of an object.

<expression> . <name>

Above, the <expression> evaluates to an object, and <name> is the name of an attribute for that object
