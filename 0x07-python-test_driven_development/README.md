This is a 0x07-python-test_driven_development project directory.

Testing is the process of evaluating a system or its component(s) with the intent to find whether it satisfies the specified requirements or not. Testing is executing a system in order to identify any gaps, errors, or missing requirements contrary to the actual requirements. 


There are two main frameworks for testing:

1. Doctest - Doctest is an inbuilt test framework that comes bundled with Python by default. The doctest module searches for code fragments that resemble interactive Python sessions and runs those sessions to confirm they operate as shown.

2. unittest - Unittest test case runners allow more options when running tests, like reporting test statistics such as tests that passed and failed.

Unittest uses methods created in classes to manage tests. It has support for automation, setup, and shutdown code when testing. Unittest has several rich, in-built features that are unavailable in doctest, including generators and group fixture managers like setUp and tearDow
